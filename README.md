# Libft

This is my first project at 42.
C programming can be very tedious when one doesnâ€™t have access to the highly useful
standard functions. This project is about understanding the way these functions work,
implementing and learning to use them. Your will create your own library. It will be
helpful since you will use it in your next C school assignments.

The Goal of this project is to learn the basic of C programming throughout the rewrite of a part of the standard library
